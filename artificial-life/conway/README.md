# Conways Game of Life

This is a web implementation of the popular "Conways Game of Life", a cell simulation with simple rules resulting in interesting formations.

If you have further ideas or found a bug, don't hesitate to send me a mail or create an issue.

### Feature and Ideas:
- [X] Start / Stop / Step Simulation
- [X] Step Counter
- [X] Change Speed of Simulation
- [X] Different Rules
- [X] Library of known structures
- [-] Different Border Configurations
- [ ] Run Simulation until Step X
- [ ] Outputs: like number of living cells
- [ ] Change Canvas Size
- [ ] Full Screen
- [ ] Draw individual Cells with mouse input
- [ ] Rotate Structures in Library
- [ ] Implement Rule Evaluation as Kernels in WebGL for better performance ^^'
